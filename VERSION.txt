Deepend Version History.

deepend-2.1
- Renamed Scope_Bomb type to Scoped_Subpool_Handle
- Added Create_Subpool call that returns a Scoped_Subpool_Handle
- Changed binary tree test code to use Scoped_Subpool_Handles

deepend-2.0
- Major redesign to work with the Ada 2012 described in AI05-0111-3.
- Subpools can no longer have subpools. This did not seem to be necessary
  and added runtime complexity. Instead, the root pool can have any number
  of subpools concurrently.
- Synchronization added to pools subpool list, to allow tasks to create 
  subpools

deepend-1.3
- Added alternate preview of Ada 2012 version, depending on whether
  further changes can be made to the Ada 2012 proposal. The alternate
  version is intended to be considered as safer than the previous version
  since it avoids dangling reference possibilities for subpool handles.

deepend-1.2
- Removed binding to Apache Runtime Pools library. Deepend is now pure Ada 
  source.

deepend-1.1
-  Addressed comments from initial code review.
