Deepend Version History.

deepend-1.3
- Added alternate preview of Ada 2012 version, depending on whether
  further changes can be made to the Ada 2012 proposal. The alternate
  version is intended to be considered as safer than the previous version
  since it avoids dangling reference possibilities for subpool handles.

deepend-1.2
- Removed binding to Apache Runtime Pools library. Deepend is now pure Ada 
  source.

deepend-1.1
-  Addressed comments from initial code review.
