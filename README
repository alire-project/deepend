1.0 INTRODUCTION
================

Deepend is a Mark and Release storage pool with Subpool capabilities for Ada 2005.

It provides a binding to the Apache Runtime Pools implementation.

Rather than deallocate items individually, which is error prone and subceptable to 
memory leaks and other memory issues, a Mark Release pool allows the pool to be
freed all at once, automatically when the pool object goes out of scope.

Have you ever wondered why Deallocating in Ada is called Unchecked_Deallocation, and
requires a bit more effort than delete in other languages?

Part of the reason has to do with the potential memory issues alluded to above.

With this Mark and Release Storage pool, Unchecked_Deallocation is implemented as 
a No OP (null procedure), because it is not needed or intended to be used.

A Mark and Release pool provides a safer means of memory management.

Deepend is free software.  See the file COPYING for copying permission. Most of the source
code is released under the GMGPL (GNAT Modified GPL) See the individual source files for
details.

Any comments on the generics would be greatly appreciated.

2. SUPPORTED TARGETS AND COMPILERS
=================================

The storage pool has only been tested on Linux. The storage pool bindings themselve
should be portable to any Ada 2005 supported platform, however since the software
links to the Apache Runtime, the software is also limited to platforms where 
the Apache Runtime libraries have been ported.

3. TEST EXECUTABLES
===================

A simple test executable test_deepend executable exercises the bindings.

The bindings have also been tested with Paraffin (See http://paraffin.sourceforge.net) code to
create a binary tree in parallel to a predetermined depth. This excercised the subpool capability,
as each worker task created its own subpool to store its own nodes, which were later processed,
by the parent task.
